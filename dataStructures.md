## Data Structures: Introduction

A way to organize data so that the data (of any datatype) is easily retrieved.

Algorithms + Data Structres = Programs

Data needs to be stored in a specific format.. aka Data Structures

### Most Common Data Structures
1. arrays
2. hashes
3. graphs
4. stacks
5. queues
6. linked lists
7. trees
8. tries



### Computers Need Space Complexity...
- RAM: Random Access Memory; holds calculations in memory; RAM looses memory when computer is shut down or browser shut down. Massive storage area. Each address holds bits (8 bits = 1 byte). 
- Storage: persistent storage; it is slow though; storage holds things in memory. 
- CPU: does the calculations inside the computer; CPU needs access to the RAM and the storage. CPU can access the RAM much faster than the storage. 

Why is this important for data structures?
- integers are usually stored as 32 bits (example: var a = 1)
- Integer Overflow: a computer can only store a certain amount of information 
- each datatype has a certain amount of bits
- a datastructure is an arrangement of data -- how it is arranged in RAM

Operations Made on Data Structures
1. insertion (self explanatory): adding a new data item in a data structure
2. deletion: removing a data item from a data structure
3. traversal: accessing each data item exactly once so it can be processed
4. searching: finding the location of a data item + if it exists in a data structure:
5. sorting (self explanatory): reorganizing data by a specific condition
6. access:
