# DataStructuresAlgos

This repository is a personal, study guide and practice space for my research into Data Structures and Algorithms. 

Here, I will be loading plenty of notes and practice technical interview questons. I do not promise any of this material to be of substance to you, a stranger; unless it is. This is my experimental collection of trying to understand what lies beneath the code. 

Thanks!
