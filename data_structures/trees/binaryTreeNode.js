// BINARY TREE NODE

// a Binary Tree Node has a value property, left property and right propery

class BinaryTreeNode{
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value
        this.left = null
        this.right = null
    }
}

// a perfect binary tree is symmetrical; everything is filled

// a full binary tree: when a node either has 0 or 2 children; never only 1 child
