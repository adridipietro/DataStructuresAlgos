# TREES

* Hierarchical data structure.
* Made up of nodes.
* Starts with a single root node; every node thereafter descends from this root node. 
* Every child node descends from a single parent node. 
* Unidirectional flow: A node can only point to a child.
* Leaf nodes - nodes at the end of the tree. 
* The DOM is an example of a TREE. 
* Nodes can contain any type of information or data. 
* A Linked List is a like a branch of a tree -- it is linear and singular. 
* There are a lot of different types of trees:
    * Binary


## BINARY TREE

* It is a type of tree. 
* Each node can only have zero, one or two nodes. 
* Each child can only have 1 parent. 
* Each node represents a certain state. 

### PERFECT BINARY TREE

* A Perfect Binary Tree is symmetrical; everything is filled - every node has two (2) children. 
* Perfect Binary trees are very efficient. 
* As we move down the tree, the amount of nodes double from the previous level. 
    * Example: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8
* Perfect Binary trees are predicatble and formulaic. 
* The bottom level of nodes ALWAYS represents almost HALF of the amount of total nodes in the tree. 

### FULL BINARY TREE 

* A Full Binary Tree is asymmetrical.
* A node either has zero (0) or two (2) children; never only 1 child.

## BIG O NOTATION

* Lookup O(log N)
* Insert O(log N)
* Delete O(log N)
