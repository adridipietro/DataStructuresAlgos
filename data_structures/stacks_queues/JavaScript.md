# WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?

JavaScript's engine is called 'V8'. V8 has a callstack and a memory heap. 


JavaScript is single-threaded -- meaning it has one (1) call stack. 

JavaScript is also non-blocking -- meaning JS does not wait around for things that take a lot of time ==> this is why we use asynchronous behavior. 

Synchronous => once first thing is finished, only then can the next thing can start; and so on.

Asynchronous => allowing callback functions -- code is not necessarily executed in order. Stores code block in the call stack to be called at a later time. 

In order for JavaScript to run, we need the JavaScript Run-Time Environment and the JavaScript Enginer ('V8').

1. Call Stack
2. Web API
3. Callback Queue
4. Event Loop
